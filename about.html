        <h2>I'm learning to code...</h2>
        <p>By day I'm a digital marketer and SEO & marketing operations consultant. I work at a SaaS startup, and have
          been in this space for
          10+ years. I enjoy marketing so much that I have a podcast called <a
            href="https://humansofmartech.com/">Humans of Martech</a>.</p>
        <p>Like many marketers in the SaaS space, I work closely with developers. As an SEO, I work closely with web
          development teams.</p>
        <p>One of the things I hate most in my career is not being able to do something myself. My ideas always need
          someone else to execute.</p>
        <p>So I started to learn to code.</p>
        <h3>Feeding curiousity</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code at the end of 2020. Part of it was out of a personal need to prove I could learn
          something technical. Part of it was a challenge to dedicate myself to my biggest learning project since
          learning digital marketing (or, as it feels like now, since University).</p>
        <p>I'm a coding hobbyist. I have 4 kids (you read that right), a full-time career I love, and a pdocastt -- I'm
          learning to code because I deeply enjoy it. </p>
        <h3>Learning to go slow</h3>
        <p>My dad always told me to slow down. "Slow down," he'd say. "You don't need to be in a rush!" </p>
        <p>Coding has forced me to slow down. If you read Reddit, you'll find that the vast majority of people learning
          to code are doing so to switch careers. They're motivated and, some of them, can dedicate themselves to this
          full-time.</p>
        <p>That is not me.</p>
        <p>You can see my progress as a developer in <a href="/projects">Projects</a>. Coding has humbled me &ndash; as
          I believe learning anything challenging should.</p>
        <p>This blog is both a coding project itself and a creative outlet. I am sharing my journey because I think that
          other people (not just marketers) are curious about learning to code as a hobby.</p>
        <p>Welcome to my experiment!</p>
